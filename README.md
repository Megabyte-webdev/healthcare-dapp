# HealthCare DApp - Decentralized Healthcare Record System

This project is a decentralized application (DApp) built using React, Vite, and Ethereum smart contracts to manage healthcare records securely and efficiently on the blockchain. The goal is to allow healthcare providers to securely add, fetch, and manage patient records using blockchain technology.

## Features

    Connect with MetaMask: Allows users to connect their wallet to the DApp.
    Smart Contract Interaction: Users can interact with the smart contract to fetch, add, and authorize healthcare provider records.
    Role-based Access Control: Only authorized healthcare providers and the owner can add and access patient records.
    React Frontend: Provides a user-friendly interface built with React.
    MetaMask Integration: Ensures users are notified if MetaMask is installed and connected.
